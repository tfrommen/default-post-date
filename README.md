Have you ever had to create a fair amount of posts that all should be published on an individual date other than today?

Maybe some reviews of an event a while back? Or a bunch of essays scheduled for the day after tomorrow?

This is exactly when _Default Post Date_ kicks in.

1. Upload contents to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory on your web server.
1. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress.
1. Find the new _Default Post Date_ setting on the _General Settings_ page in your WordPress backend.
